Having clean, easy-to-read code makes you stand out as a programmer and makes it easier for others to use and work off of.\nâ€‹")]),e._v(" "),s("h2",{attrs:{id:"classes"}},[s("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#classes"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Classes")]),e._v(" "),s("p",[e._v("Classes should be named in UpperCamelCase.
